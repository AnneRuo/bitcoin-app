# Vincit Rising Star Pre-assignment

### Bitcoin App

A React application to analyze bitcoin's market value for a date range given by the user. Application uses CoinGeckoâ€™s public API.

## Project Status

This project is currently in development.

User can get data for a given date range but the application does not yet take into account that the data comes more than once a day if the date range is less than 91 days. This leads to the wrong amount of days regarding the longest bearish (downward) trend if date range is not over 90 days.

Otherwise the application is ready and easily extensible when new features are to be added.
